<h2>The difference between lossy and lossless compression on images</h2>
<p>Lossless and lossy compression are characterizations which are used to explicate the distinction between two file compression formats. 
</br>
One (lossless) allows for all of the original data to be recovered whenever the file is uncompressed again. The other (lossy) works differently since it ends up eliminating all
</br>
the “unnecessary” bits and pieces of information in the original file to make it smaller when compressed. 
</br>
The question some people often ask is how can I choose between the two, or when? The answer to that question, largely depends on several factors. 
</br>
One, is the size and type of file you want to compress or convert. Secondly, the amount of space available, as well as the amount of space you want to save.</p>

<h2>Why is it important for web designers to compress image files?</h2>
<p>Photos, images and graphics are great additions to any website. A graphic helps people to understand the topic and gives them an instant frame of reference. Graphics also make beautiful headers or logos which instantly define your website. The funny part about images is - people usually think the site with graphics is better. Even if a plain site has better content and more information, visitors automatically gravitate to images.
</br>
Despite the fact that images are beneficial, there are rules in their use, and ignoring internet protocol could be a disadvantage to your website. After all, web browsers give users the option of turning graphics off which means there is a valid reason for not loading images.
</br>
Unfortunately, many webmasters get carried away with their perceptions of what visitors need. They either think big is good or they do not think at all, and just upload all kinds of massive file sizes to the server. But, the bottom line is if you use a large photo, expect there to be negative consequences.
</br>
Following is a list of reasons why you must limit your images and understand the importance of keeping file sizes of your images small.</p>
