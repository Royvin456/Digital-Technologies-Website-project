<h2>Lossless Audio:</h2>
<ul>
	<li>MPEG-4 SLS</li>
	<li>Audio Interchange File Format</li>
	<li>Windows Media Audio Lossless</li>
</ul>
<h2>Why us Lossless File Formats</h2>
<p>Using lossless audio format gives you an exact bit-for-bit copy of the original music.
</br>
You are able to convert a lossless file into any format and have the highest quality that format can support.</p>

<h2>Lossy Audio Files:</h2>
<ul>
    <li>OGG</li>
	<li>MP4</li>
	<li>MP3</li>
</ul>
<h2>How does Lossy compression work</h2>
<p>When you convert an audio file to a lossy format such as MP4, the machine analyses all the 
</br>
frequencies of the audio that you have formatted, then it discards frequencies that the human
</br>
cannot hear, but for very low frequency sounds it is usually filtered out having
</br>
a minor impact on what the audio sounds like.</p>

<h2>Why use lossy file formats</h2>
<p>You should use lossy format files because it uses up less space and it 
</br>
brings out the best sounding audio when you listen to it</p>
